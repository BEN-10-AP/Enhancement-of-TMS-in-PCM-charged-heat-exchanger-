# Enhancement-of-TMS-in-PCM-charged-heat-exchanger-
### - Objective of the project:
</br>
To estimate the performance capability of heat exchanger, charged with PCM (gallium) material in the shell region, with and without fin.
</br>
The outer pipe surface(Aluminium) is maintained at a constant temperature of 50 C. Initially PCM is at 27 C. MP of (PCM) Gallium is 29.2C .
</br>
### - Results:
Without fins 100% melting time = 719s
</br>
With hexagonal fins 100% melting time = 481s
