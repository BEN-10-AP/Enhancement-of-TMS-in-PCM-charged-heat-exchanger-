# Enhancement of Thermal Management System in Phase Change Material (PCM) charged heat exchanger-
### - Objective of the project:
</br>
To estimate the performance capability of heat exchanger, charged with PCM (gallium) material in the shell region, with and without fin.
</br>
 <h2>Boundary Conditions & Initial Conditions:</h2>
- ✨ The 4 annular pipe surface(Aluminium) is maintained at a constant temperature of 50 C. 
- ✨ Outermost pipe has adiabatic boundary condition.
- ✨ Initially PCM is at 27 C.
</br>
<h2>Setup details:</h2>
- ✨ Transient
- ✨ Viscous(Laminar) model (movement of gallium in melting region is laminar)
- ✨ Gravity (-9.81m/s^2) in y direction
- ✨ Boussinesq approximation for density
- ✨ PCM material is gallium
- ✨ Melting point of gallium = 29.2 C

<h2>Project Results:</h2>
- ✨ Without fins 100% melting time = 719s
</br>
- ✨ With hexagonal fins 100% melting time = 481s

<h2>Project Conclusion:</h2>
Fins improvise heat transfer thus, can enhance melting and solidification for PCM materials.
